## Project/Goals
(fill in your description and goals here)

## Process
### (your step 1)

The Tuberculosis dataset given by country is a .csv file composed of one physical table called "TB_Burden_Country" with 47 fields or columns and 5120 rows in total.

ISO 2 and ISO 3 character given by country or territory (abreviation)
ISO-numerical given by country/territory code;
The estimated total number of a population given by year;
Prevalence of TB (All formas) per 100 000 population
Prevalence of TB (All formas) per 100 000 population, low bound
Prevalence of TB (All formas) per 100 000 population, high bound

low-bound meaning
high-bound meaning


hiv in tb cases x non-hiv in tb cases: how does it affect it?

- Ckecking the datatypes of each column and changing some of them ("Region" converted to the geographical role "Country/Region")
- Updating columns names (such as by removing the expression "estimated" of the labels to make them more readable even though as a data anlyst I know these anumbers all all approximate/estimates);
- Checking Null or NaN values (such as under the table "Mortality of TB cases who are HIV-positive, per 1000.000 population low bound" and "Mortality of TB cases who are HIV-positive, per 100 000 population, high bound" were full of rows with null values)
- Creating 2 relational hyerarchies in the table, such as between "Country/Terriotry", "Region", ISO-2"and ISO-3" which were under "Country/Territory or ISO Classification" and "Methods to Derive Estimates" which groupe the methods to derive incidence estimates, prevalence estimats, mortality estimates and TBHIV estimates.

## Results
(Fill in which Option you chose, either 1 or 2. List the dataset you selected for the project if you selected Option 2. Also, discuss the visualizations you created, and why. For Option 2, also identify what your data question was, and how you went through the prompts.)
